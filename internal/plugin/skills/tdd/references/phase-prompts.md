# Phase Prompt Templates

Lean "phase brief" templates. The orchestrator fills in the `{variables}` and spawns the subagent. Subagents read their own context from disk — the orchestrator does NOT paste file contents into prompts.

**Principle:** Tell the subagent WHAT to do and WHERE to find context. The subagent reads the context itself.

---

## Session Constants

Discovered once during Setup (Stage 0a) and reused in every phase brief:

```
Plan file: {plan_file_path}            # e.g., "docs/plans/2026-02-07-category-search.md"
Test command: {test_command}           # e.g., "pnpm vitest run --reporter=verbose"
Test file pattern: {test_pattern}       # e.g., "colocated *.test.ts" or "tests/__tests__/"
Test helpers: {helper_paths}            # e.g., "tests/helpers/isolated-test-household.ts"
Standards file: {standards_path}        # .claude/skills/tdd/references/test-standards.md
E2E test command: {e2e_test_command}   # e.g., "pnpm playwright test"
E2E test directory: {e2e_test_dir}     # e.g., "tests/e2e/"
Auth fixture: {auth_fixture_path}      # e.g., "tests/e2e/fixtures/auth-fixture.ts"
Acceptance test path: {acceptance_test_path}  # Set after Stage 0f. Empty if non-user-facing.
```

## Planning Phase: Plan subagent

### When

User chose "Auto-generate plan" from Stage 0-plan heuristic gate.

### Template

````
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "Plan"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Generate TDD implementation plan"
  prompt: |
    ## Task

    Create a Test-Driven Development implementation plan in Kent Beck format (incremental slices with checkbox tests).

    ## Feature/Bug Description

    {user_description}

    ## Required Format

    ```markdown
    # TDD Plan: {feature_name}

    ## Context
    [1-2 sentences: what problem this solves, why it matters]

    ## Architecture
    [2-3 sentences: chosen approach, critical files, integration points, key decisions]

    ## Session Constants
    Test command: {infer from project — look for package.json scripts, vitest.config.ts, etc.}
    Test file pattern: {infer from existing test files — colocated *.test.ts, tests/**/*.test.ts, etc.}
    Test helpers: {identify from tests/helpers/ or similar directories}

    ## Slice 1: {foundation — core logic/data model}
    Type: {unit|integration|e2e|pgtap} | Status: pending
    Files: {exact paths to test file and implementation file}

    - [ ] {specific test case — happy path, be concrete}
    - [ ] {edge case — empty input, null, undefined}
    - [ ] {edge case — invalid input, boundary conditions}
    - [ ] {error handling if applicable}

    ## Slice 2: {next layer — API endpoint, integration, UI}
    Type: {unit|integration|e2e|pgtap} | Status: pending
    Files: {exact paths}

    - [ ] {test case}
    - [ ] {test case}
    - [ ] {test case}

    [Continue with Slice 3, 4, etc. as complexity requires]
    ```

    ## Guidelines

    1. **Incremental slices**: Each slice builds on the previous. Order matters.
       - Slice 1: Core logic, data model, validation (unit tests typically)
       - Slice 2: Integration layer (API, database operations)
       - Slice 3: Edge cases, error handling, concurrency
       - Slice 4+: Additional features, optimizations

    2. **Slice count**: 3-6 slices typical
       - Simple features: 3 slices
       - Medium features: 4-5 slices
       - Complex features: 6+ slices

    3. **Test granularity**: Each checkbox is ONE test
       - Be specific: "should reject duplicate category name in same household"
       - Not vague: "test validation"

    4. **File paths**: Identify actual paths from the codebase
       - Use codebase search to find existing test directories
       - Follow project conventions (colocated vs tests/ directory)

    5. **Test types**:
       - unit: Pure functions, business logic, utilities
       - integration: Database operations, API routes, RLS policies
       - e2e: User workflows through real browser (Playwright)
       - pgtap: Database constraints, triggers, RLS (PostgreSQL)

    6. **Context to read before planning**:
       - `.claude/skills/tdd/references/test-standards.md` — testing patterns
       - Existing test files in the codebase — follow conventions
       - Related source files — understand current architecture
       - Database schema if relevant (supabase/migrations/)

    7. **Consider**:
       - RLS (Row Level Security) if using Supabase
       - Validation at boundaries (user input, API responses)
       - Concurrency and race conditions where applicable
       - Error states and failure modes
       - Edge cases: empty, null, duplicate, not-found, unauthorized

    ## Output

    Return the plan in the exact markdown format above. The TDD orchestrator will:
    1. Save it to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-slug>.md
    2. Present to user for approval/edits
    3. Extract session constants
    4. Begin RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles

## Plan Review Phase: tdd-plan-reviewer

### When

After plan is created (via Plan Mode, auto-generation, or manual), before user approval.

### Purpose

Fresh eyes quality gate — catch TDD gaps, YAGNI violations, missing slices, architectural issues before RED-GREEN-REFACTOR begins.

### Template

````
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Review TDD plan for quality and completeness"
  prompt: |
    ## Task

    Review the TDD plan from a senior engineer lens. Evaluate testability, completeness, and architectural fit. Return findings before implementation begins.

    ## Files to Review

    Plan file: {plan_file_path}
    CLAUDE.md: .claude/CLAUDE.md (project standards and patterns)
    Related source files: {suggested_files_to_understand_existing_architecture}

    ## Evaluation Criteria

    For each plan slice, use sequential thinking to evaluate:

    1. **Testability** — Can you write a failing test for this slice? Is there a clear assertion that will pass/fail?
    2. **Slice Scope** — Is this a single logical unit or mixing multiple concerns?
    3. **Edge Cases** — What boundary conditions, error states, or data isolation scenarios are missing?
    4. **Duplication** — Does similar logic exist elsewhere that wasn't discovered?
    5. **Architecture Fit** — Does this align with the codebase's patterns, layers, conventions?
    6. **Data Isolation** — Are test fixtures clear? Cleanup explicit? Any CASCADE DELETE risks?
    7. **Abstraction Level** — Is the slice too vague ("add validation") or too granular?

    ## Return Format

    Use three categories:
    - 🔴 **Critical** — Blocks the plan (unfixable flaws)
    - 🟡 **Warning** — Requires decision (potential issues)
    - 🟢 **Note** — Improves clarity (suggestions)

    For each finding:
    - Which slice(s)
    - Specific concern (be concrete, not vague)
    - Recommended action or clarification needed

    ## Output

    Return exactly:

    ```
    ## Findings

    ### Slice: [name]
    - Category: 🔴 | 🟡 | 🟢
    - Concern: [specific issue]
    - Recommendation: [what to fix or clarify]

    ### Slice: [next]
    ...

    ## Overall Assessment
    - **Plan Quality**: Ready / Needs Changes / Blocked
    - **Key Gaps**: [list]
    - **Highest Risk Slices**: [which ones need scrutiny]

    ## Before Proceeding
    [Specific questions or changes needed before implementation]
    ```

    If no critical/warning issues: state "Plan is ready to implement" and list solid slices.

## Stage 0f: Acceptance Test (GOOS Outer Loop)

### When

After plan is approved, before inner loop begins.

**Orchestrator decision (use Sequential Thinking):** Does this feature add user-facing behaviour observable in a browser (new page, form, flow, navigation, toast, dialog)?
- YES → spawn acceptance test writer (template below)
- NO (pure utility/backend, no user journey) → skip 0f, set `Acceptance test path: none`

### Template

````
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "tdd-test-writer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "ACCEPTANCE TEST: {feature_name}"
  prompt: |
    Mode: acceptance
    Feature: {feature_name}
    Plan file: {plan_file_path}
    E2E test command: {e2e_test_command}
    E2E test directory: {e2e_test_dir}
    Auth fixture: {auth_fixture_path}
    Standards file: {standards_path}
    Write test to: {e2e_test_dir}/{feature-slug}.spec.ts

    Read the plan's Context and Architecture sections.
    Read the auth fixture to understand the fixture API.
    Read 1-2 existing E2E specs to learn naming and structure conventions.

    Write ONE Playwright acceptance test for the complete user journey.
    It must FAIL (feature doesn't exist yet).
````

### Post-0f (Orchestrator)

1. Verify test FAILS for expected reason (not syntax error)
2. Record `Acceptance test path` in session constants
3. Commit: `test: add acceptance test for {feature_name}`
4. **Do NOT run this test again during inner loop cycles** — only run at outer loop exit
5. Proceed to inner loop (Stage 1: TIDY FIRST)

---

## TIDY FIRST Phase: tdd-refactorer (prep)

**When:** Before RED phase, to prep existing code for new behavior.

**Purpose:** Evaluate if existing code needs structural changes before adding new behavior (Kent Beck's "Tidy First?" pattern).

    Files to read: {impl_file_paths}
````

---

## RED Phase: tdd-test-writer

### Pre-RED Sequential Thinking (Orchestrator)

Before spawning tdd-test-writer, the orchestrator MUST use Sequential Thinking to verify the "one test" constraint:

```
mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking:
  thought: "I need to spawn tdd-test-writer for the RED phase. Let me verify what I'm asking it to do."
  thoughtNumber: 1
  totalThoughts: 3
  nextThoughtNeeded: true

  thought: "Looking at the plan file, the next unchecked test is: '{specific_test_description}'. That's ONE specific test."
  thoughtNumber: 2
  totalThoughts: 3
  nextThoughtNeeded: true

  thought: "I will spawn tdd-test-writer with a brief that says: write EXACTLY ONE test for '{specific_test_description}'. Not multiple tests for this function. Not a batch of simple tests. ONE test. This is a hard gate — if tdd-test-writer adds multiple tests, I must reject the work and respawn with a stronger constraint."
  thoughtNumber: 3
  totalThoughts: 3
  nextThoughtNeeded: false
```

This explicit reasoning prevents the orchestrator from accidentally encouraging batching (e.g., "write tests for these validation rules" → implies multiple tests).

### Template

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "tdd-test-writer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "RED: {test_description}"
  prompt: |
    Mode: unit/integration  # Always "unit/integration" in inner loop. Acceptance test was written once in Stage 0f.
    Feature: {feature_name}
    Slice: {slice_number} — {slice_description}
    Test type: {unit|integration|e2e|pgtap}
    Test command: {test_command}
    Your test: "{next_unchecked_test_description}"
    Files to read: {plan_file_path}, {standards_path}, {existing_test_files}, {test_helpers}, {source_files}
    Already tested: {checked_list or "Nothing yet — this is the first test"}
```

### Post-RED Verification (Orchestrator)

After tdd-test-writer returns, the orchestrator MUST verify test count before checking test failure:

```
1. Read the test file that was modified
2. Count how many test cases were added in this cycle
   - Look for new `it()`, `test()`, or `SELECT plan()` (pgTAP) calls
   - Compare against plan file — only ONE test should be newly checked
3. If count > 1:
   - **HARD GATE FAILURE**
   - Message: "tdd-test-writer violated the ONE TEST constraint. It added {N} tests instead of 1. This breaks TDD feedback loops."
   - Undo the changes (git restore or manual edit)
   - Respawn tdd-test-writer with even stronger emphasis on the constraint
4. If count == 1:
   - Proceed to verify test failure (GATE 2)
```

**Example respawn prompt after batch violation:**

```
CRITICAL: Your previous attempt added {N} tests instead of ONE.

This is a HARD CONSTRAINT. TDD requires ONE test at a time.

You must write EXACTLY ONE test for: "{specific_test_description}"

Do NOT write any other tests, even if they're related or simple.
```

## Regression Analysis Phase

**Trigger:** User accepts at completion gate (Stage 7) — applies to both feature and bug-fix modes

**Invocation:**

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Analyze for test coverage gaps and edge cases"
  prompt: |
    You are performing regression analysis at the end of a TDD workflow.

    Read `.claude/skills/tdd/references/regression-analysis.md` for full methodology.

    ## Context
    Feature/Bug: {description from plan or diagnosis}
    Files modified: {list of files changed during this TDD session}
    Tests written: {list of test files created/modified}

    ## Your Task
    1. Use Sequential Thinking to analyze the change for patterns, edge cases, and integration risks
    2. Search codebase (Grep/Read) to verify findings
    3. Generate test recommendations using the priority rubric
    4. Return findings in the mandatory output format (see regression-analysis.md)

    Focus on what could go wrong, not what already works.
```

**After analysis returns findings:**

1. **Auto-filter using QUICK WIN check** (spawn general-purpose subagent per finding, max 7 concurrent):

   **Subagent brief:**

   ```
   Evaluate this regression finding using QUICK WIN criteria.

   Finding: {description, location, risk, priority}

   QUICK WIN check (ALL THREE must be true):
   ✓ Predictable cost - < 5 min, specific change, no cascading effects
   ✓ Real benefit - Fixes actual weakness (not speculative "might break")
   ✓ Confident correctness - Familiar pattern, testable, won't create new problems

   Steps:
   1. Read the flagged file and surrounding context
   2. Verify: is this an ACTUAL bug/gap or speculative concern?
      - Pattern duplication (same bug elsewhere): likely ACTUAL
      - Future brittleness (might break if...): likely SPECULATIVE
   3. Evaluate QUICK WIN criteria:
      - Predictable cost: Can we copy an existing test pattern? Is scope clear?
      - Real benefit: Does code exist? Is it actively used? Is failure likely?
      - Confident correctness: Do we know the fix? Is pattern proven?
   4. If confidence 50-79%: use Sequential Thinking to reason deeper
   5. Return: {category: "QUICK WIN" | "SKIP", confidence: 0-100, reasoning}
   ```

   **Categorization:**
   - **QUICK WIN**: Implement now (e.g., same bug pattern exists in ComponentB, we just fixed it in ComponentA)
   - **SKIP**: Defer to GitHub issue (e.g., speculative "add comprehensive error handling", unpredictable scope)

2. **Process QUICK WIN findings automatically:**
   - Spawn tdd-test-writer subagent for each QUICK WIN
   - Write tests using standard TDD workflow
   - Commit separately: `test: regression coverage for [pattern class]`

3. **Process SKIP findings automatically:**
   - Create GitHub issue for each
   - Title: `[Regression] {finding description}`
   - Body: Include location, risk, test type, reasoning for deferral
   - Labels: "regression-analysis", "test-gap"
   - Link to original PR/commit

**No user prompt** - automatic YAGNI-compliant filtering prevents scope creep while catching real bugs.

---

## Warm Loop Optimization

After 3+ successful RED-GREEN cycles without issues, the orchestrator should:

- Reduce between-phase commentary (the pattern is working)
- Spawn the next subagent immediately after gate passes
- Trust the process — don't re-explain the methodology each cycle
